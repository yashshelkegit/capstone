<!-- // Create an HTML form that allows the user to upload an image. This form should include an input field of type "file"
and a button to submit the form. -->
<form action="/upload" method="post">
    <input type="file" name="imageData">
    <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>

<!-- Create an HTML file and add an img tag with a placeholder src attribute. -->
<img id="uploaded-image" src="#" alt="Uploaded image">


<!-- Add some JavaScript code to handle the form submission and display the uploaded image. -->
<script>
    const form = document.querySelector('form');
    const image = document.getElementById('uploaded-image');

    form.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        const formData = new FormData(form);
        fetch('/upload', {
            method: 'POST',
            body: formData
        })
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => {
                const fileName = data.filename;
                const imageUrl = `/uploads/${fileName}`;
                image.src = imageUrl;
            })
            .catch(error => console.error(error));
    });
</script>

Here, we're using the Fetch API to make a POST request to the server to upload the image. When the server responds with
the filename of the uploaded image, we construct the URL of the image and set it as the src attribute of the img tag.

Note that we've added an event listener to the form to prevent the default form submission behavior, which would cause
the page to reload.
